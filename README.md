Hello!

This is a repo for repurposing some NOS CRTs from Aliexpress. It was a fun art project and I learned a lot. 

More to come!

Sorry I use git like every 2 years and probably have something screwy with my branches. Just use main and I think you'll be fine. 

Some usage instructions. After downloading all the appropriate python packages, be sure to get an API key from openweather map and add it to settings_example.json. Rename this file to settings.json and things should start working.
